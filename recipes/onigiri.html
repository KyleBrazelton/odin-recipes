    <p>Also known as o-musubi or nigirimeshi, onigiri are Japanese rice ball snacks made from cooked or steamed sushi rice, furikake seasonings (and sometimes tasty hidden fillings), wrapped a nori seaweed wrapper.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups sushi rice cooked</li>
    <li>50 grams rice seasoning aka furikake</li>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>nori sheets cut into small rectangles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pop your cooked sushi rice into a large mixing bowl. Add the furikake rice seasoning and mix through evenly. Note: if you feel like hiding something tasty inside instead, you can skip this step.</li>
    <li>Separate the rice into equal portions, approximately one large handful for each onigiri.</li>
    <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
    <li>Pick up one handful/portion of rice. If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
    <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so itâ€™s even. According to our Japanese friends, you want to end up with one face of the onigiri having a small indentation from your fingers.</li>
    <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri, rough side in towards the rice. Then fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
    <li>Repeat for the remaining rice portions.</li>
</ol>
